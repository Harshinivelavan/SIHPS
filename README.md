## Problem Title 

An application under which all rescue agencies are registered and which can display the location of other rescue relief agencies during natural/ man made calamities


## Idea

This application is designed as a unified digital platform where all rescue and relief agencies can register and coordinate during natural or man-made disasters. It provides a real-time interactive map that displays the live locations and statuses of medical teams, volunteer groups, shelters, and emergency response units, enabling faster and more organized rescue operations. By centralizing information, the system helps agencies avoid duplication of efforts, identify nearby resources quickly, and improve communication during crisis situations. Although this version is only a UI mockup, it represents the foundation for a powerful coordination tool that can significantly enhance disaster response efficiency and safety.

## Use Cases

1. Real-Time Location Tracking of Agencies

During disasters, responders need to quickly see which agencies are nearby.
The system shows the live location and status of medical teams, volunteer groups, shelters, and supply units, helping coordinators deploy resources efficiently.

2. Centralized Registration of All Agencies

Government bodies or disaster-management authorities can maintain one unified registry.
New agencies can sign up, update their capabilities, operational status, and contact details.

3. Incident Response Coordination

When an incident (flood, fire, earthquake) occurs, all agencies can receive instant updates.
Command centers can assign teams, track their movement, and verify availability.
